## Section One

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

## Section Two

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Section Three

You can also print data frames

```{r}
mtcars
```
