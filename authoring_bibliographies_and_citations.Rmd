## Bibliographies

### Specifying a Bibliography

Pandoc can automatically generate citations and a bibliography in a number of styles.  In order to use this feature, you will need to specify a bibliography file
using the `bibliography` metadata field in a YAML metadata section. For example:

    ---
    title: "Sample Document"
    output: html_document
    bibliography: bibliography.json
    ---

The bibliography may have any of these formats:

  Format            File extension
  ------------      --------------
  CSL-JSON          .json
  MODS              .mods
  BibLaTeX          .bib
  BibTeX            .bibtex
  RIS               .ris
  EndNote           .enl
  EndNote XML       .xml
  ISI               .wos
  MEDLINE           .medline
  Copac             .copac

[CSL-JSON](https://citeproc-js.readthedocs.io/en/latest/csl-json/markup.html) 
is the recommended format. This is the native format for
Pandoc's citation processor, `pandoc-citeproc`. All other types 
are internally converted to CSL-JSON. 

Note that `.bib` can generally be used with both BibTeX and BibLaTeX
files, but you can use `.bibtex` to force BibTeX.

### Inline References

Alternatively you can use a `references` field in the document's YAML
metadata.  This should include an array of YAML-encoded references,
for example:

    ---
    references:
    - id: fenner2012a
      title: One-click science marketing
      author:
      - family: Fenner
        given: Martin
      container-title: Nature Materials
      volume: 11
      URL: 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmat3283'
      DOI: 10.1038/nmat3283
      issue: 4
      publisher: Nature Publishing Group
      page: 261-263
      type: article-journal
      issued:
        year: 2012
        month: 3
    ---

### Bibliography Placement

Bibliographies will be placed at the end of the document.  Normally, you will want to end your document with an appropriate header:

    last paragraph...

    # References

The bibliography will be inserted after this header.

## Citations

### Citation Syntax

Citations go inside square brackets and are separated by semicolons.
Each citation must have a key, composed of '@' + the citation
identifier from the database, and may optionally have a prefix,
a locator, and a suffix.  Here are some examples:

    Blah blah [see @doe99, pp. 33-35; also @smith04, ch. 1].

    Blah blah [@doe99, pp. 33-35, 38-39 and *passim*].

    Blah blah [@smith04; @doe99].

A minus sign (`-`) before the `@` will suppress mention of
the author in the citation.  This can be useful when the
author is already mentioned in the text:

    Smith says blah [-@smith04].

You can also write an in-text citation, as follows:

    @smith04 says blah.

    @smith04 [p. 33] says blah.

### Unused References (nocite)

If you want to include items in the bibliography without actually
citing them in the body text, you can define a dummy `nocite` metadata
field and put the citations there:

    ---
    nocite: | 
      @item1, @item2
    ...

    @item3

In this example, the document will contain a citation for `item3`
only, but the bibliography will contain entries for `item1`, `item2`, and
`item3`.

### Citation Styles

By default, pandoc will use a Chicago author-date format for
citations and references. To use another style, you will need to specify
a CSL 1.0 style file in the `csl` metadata field. For example:

    ---
    title: "Sample Document"
    output: html_document
    bibliography: bibliography.bib
    csl: biomed-central.csl
    ---

A primer on creating and
modifying CSL styles can be found at
<http://citationstyles.org/downloads/primer.html>.  A repository of CSL styles
can be found at <https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles>.  See also
<http://zotero.org/styles> for easy browsing.

### Citations for PDF Output

By default, citations are generated by the utility `pandoc-citeproc`, and it works for all output formats. When the output is LaTeX/PDF, you can also use LaTeX packages (e.g. `natbib`) to generate citations; see [PDF documents](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/pdf-document.html) for details.
