# Overview

If you are new to using R Markdown, we encourage you to start with a systematic overview, rather than diving right in to reading documentation pages. The best place to start is the ["Communication" section](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/communicate-intro.html) in the book "R for Data Science" (R4DS for short), an O’Reilly book written by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund.

Here are the chapters that cover R Markdown, as summarized by Hadley and Garrett:

* In [R Markdown](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html), you will learn about R Markdown, a tool for integrating
  prose, code, and results. You can use R Markdown in notebook mode for 
  analyst-to-analyst communication, and in report mode for 
  analyst-to-decision-maker communication. Thanks to the power of R Markdown
  formats, you can even use the same document for both purposes.
  
* In [R Markdown formats](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown-formats.html), you'll learn a little about the many other varieties
  of outputs you can produce using R Markdown, including dashboards, websites,
  and books.
  
* We'll finish up with [R Markdown workflow](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown-workflow.html), where you'll learn about the
  "analysis notebook" and how to systematically record your successes and failures so that you can learn from them.

# Tutorials

The [R Markdown website](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) offers a series of tutorials you can follow to see what is possible with R Markdown. 

These tutorials offer accompanying [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) lessons you can use right away in your browser.

You can also access links to all these tutorials in the **"Get Started"** section from the top of this page.

# User Guide

Written by the authors of the **rmarkdown** package, [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) provides a comprehensive user guide to the complete R Markdown ecosystem for authoring documents. The book is published by Chapman & Hall/CRC, and you can read it online for free.

<a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/"><img data-uri="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/images/cover.png" alt="R Markdown: The Definitive Guide" width="250" style="padding: 0 15px; float: right;"/></a>

The book is structured into four parts:

* [Part I](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/installation.html) introduces how to install the relevant packages, and provides an overview of R Markdown, including the possible output formats, the Markdown syntax, the R code chunk syntax, and how to use other languages in R Markdown.

* [Part II](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/documents.html) is the detailed documentation of built-in output formats in the rmarkdown package, including document formats and presentation formats. These output formats are "built-in" because you do not need any other R packages other than rmarkdown to use them.

* [Part III](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/dashboards.html) documents several R Markdown extension packages that enable you to build different applications or generate output documents with different styles. These output formats are "extensions" because you will need to install R packages, in addition to rmarkdown, to use them.

* [Part IV](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/parameterized-reports.html) covers advanced topics about R Markdown.

# Cheatsheets

<a href="https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf"><img data-uri="https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/rmarkdown-2.0.png" alt="R Markdown cheatsheet" width="450" style="padding: 0 15px; float: right;"/></a>

The [R Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf) is a one page (two-sided) reference guide you can download as a quick reference while you work.

The [R Markdown Reference](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf) is a five page guide that lists each of the options from markdown, knitr, and pandoc that you can use to customize your R Markdown documents. 

You can access both files from within the RStudio IDE:

+ R Markdown Cheat Sheet: *Help > Cheatsheets > R Markdown Cheat Sheet*,

+ R Markdown Reference Guide: *Help > Cheatsheets > R Markdown Reference Guide*.

```{js, echo=FALSE}
(function() {
  var img, imgs = document.querySelectorAll('img');
  for (var i = 0; i < imgs.length; i++) {
    img = imgs[i];
    if (!img.src && img.dataset['uri']) img.src = img.dataset['uri'];
  }
})();
```
